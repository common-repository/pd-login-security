Stable tag: 1.0.4

Disables the default login errors, adding more security to the login form of your WordPress install.

== Description ==

By default WordPress will tell anyone trying to gain access what they did wrong when trying to bruteforce your site. This plugin hides the reason the login failed. This way an attacker will have a harder time getting in.

== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= Can I modify the message that is being displayed? =

No. At this time this plugin works with one, predefined message. I'm working on a way to modify this message in a future release.

= Why should I alter the error message? =

WordPress will give the user a clue on what he's doing wrong. So when somebody wants to access your site they will know wether the password, or the username is incorrect. By hiding this information you can make it a slight bit harder for people to get in to your account. 

= Why did you create this plugin? =

I have two main reasons to create this plugin. The first would be that I encourage everybody to secure their websites as much as possible. This plugin makes that a slight bit easier. The second reason is that I wanted to experiment with the WordPress plugin repository.
